**A Pragmatic Framework for Assessing
Competency-based Courses.**

## Description

Our paper presents a Competency-Based
Education (CBE) model called the *Competency Assessment and Monitoring (C-A&M+)* framework. This repository includes the following 15 courses taught in 8 university degrees at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso (PUCV), where C-A&M+ is used:
